<b><br>Image_overlap.cpp</br></b>
  
Two images A and B are given, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)

We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

(Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.)

What is the largest possible overlap?

Example 1:

Input: A = [[1,1,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,1,0]]
       B = [[0,0,0],
            [0,1,1],
            [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We slide A to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.

<b><br> tilt_tree.cpp</br></b>
<br>
Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

<b><br> diameter_binary_tree.cpp</br></b>
<br>

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

<br>***************************************************************************<br>

<b><br> Symmetric_Tree_recursive.cpp</br></b>
<br>

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

<b><br> Binary_Tree_Level_Order_Traversal_store_in_multidimensional_array.cpp</br></b>
<br>

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]

<br>***************************************************************************<br>

<b><br> min_depth_binary_tree_recursive.cpp </br></b>
<br>

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

<br>***************************************************************************<br>

<b><br>intersection_of_Two_Arrays.cpp</br></b>
<br>
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.


<br>***************************************************************************<br>

<b><br>LRU_Cache.cpp</br></b>
<br>
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

Example:

LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4

<b><br>Plus_One.cpp</br></b>
<br>
Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Example 2:

Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.

<b><br>implement_stack_using_linked_list.cpp </br></b>
<br>
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
Example:
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.

<b><br>count_complete_b_tree.cpp </br></b>
<br>

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

<b><br>Monotonic_Array.cpp </br></b>
<br>
An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array A is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, A[i] <= A[j].  An array A is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, A[i] >= A[j].

Return true if and only if the given array A is monotonic.

<b><br>Arranging_Coins.cpp </br></b>
<br>
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

<b><br>3SUM.cpp </br></b>
<br>

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:

Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

<b><br>BST Successor Search.cpp</br></b>
<br>
BST Successor Search
In a Binary Search Tree (BST), an Inorder Successor of a node is defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node (see examples below). Given a node inputNode in a BST, you’re asked to write a function findInOrderSuccessor that returns the Inorder Successor of inputNode. If inputNode has no Inorder Successor, return null.

<b><br>Longest Univalue Path.cpp</br></b>
<br>

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

<br>***************************************************************************<br>
<b><br>restore_ip_addresses.cpp</br></b>
<br>
Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.

Example:

<b><br>Poor_Pigs.cpp</br></b>
<br>

There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.

Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.

Follow-up:

If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the "poison" bucket within p minutes? There is exact one bucket with poison.

<b><br>card_flipping_game.cpp</br></b>
<br>


On a table are N cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 

If the number X on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number X is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output 0.

Here, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of card i. 

A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.

Example:

Input: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we flip the second card, the fronts are [1,3,4,4,7] and the backs are [1,2,4,1,3].
We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on the front of any card, so 2 is good.

<b><br>Divide Two Integers.cpp</br></b>
<br>

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Note:

Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
The divisor will never be 0.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers 
within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 
when the division result overflows.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]

Return the following binary tree:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
